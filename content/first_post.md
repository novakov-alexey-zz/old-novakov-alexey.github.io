# Hello Static Website

Finaly, I have set up a separate web-site for blogging. After strugguling for several years with Medium platform, I decided 
to go with staticly generated web-site using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and GitHub Pages.  What I do not like at Medium is its poor syntax highlighting 
for program code and very limited HTML styles. Basically, every page looks like a next clone of any other page there.  

My old articales will be still available here:
